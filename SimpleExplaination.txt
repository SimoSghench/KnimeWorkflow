The second minicontest is a multi-instance regression problem in which we have to predict a value called rain quantity based on the output of six photosensors.
I used the pre-processed training set in which the input is aggregated using some statistics like min, max, mean, std deviation and so on.
I implemented a form of stacking with two base classifiers and a simple metalearner, a linear regression learner.
